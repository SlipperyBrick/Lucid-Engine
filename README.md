Lucid Engine is the result of my BSc Computing (Games Development) undergraduate degree major project. With a large passion for 3D graphics I decided to persue the idea of a rendering engine that offered a simple front-end editor to construct 3D scenes.

Whilst Lucid Engine has outgrown my undergraduate degree and continues to see development, my ambition is to make a rendering engine with an editor layer that supports a robust rendering system that allows extension to implement a variety of interesting rendering techniques that provide gorgeous visuals.

During my undergraduate degree I decided fairly early on that I wanted to design and implement my own rendering engine, with the goal of learning as much as possible in terms of application design, computer graphics and all topics that encapsulate rendering and 3D graphics.

With project ideas available to choose for an end of year major project I decided to focus on the topic of deferred rendering. The primary goal was to implement a solution for solving transparency in a deferred rendering system. Many techniques exist that solve this issue, but after further research and development of my project I settled on implementing dual-depth peeling and documenting the performance of this algorithm with a custom-made rendering engine and modern computing hardware.

I intend on continuing development of Lucid Engine with further improvements to the lighting model it currently uses. Physically-based approaches offer incredible realism and will be my next focus. Other backend improvements to the renderer is also on the roadmap with big interests in exploring the implementation of other graphics API's such as DirectX or Vulkan.
